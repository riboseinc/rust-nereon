# Multi-configuration parser library

This crate is unstable and liable to change.

This is a Rust FFI wrapper around (and so depends upon)
[libnereon](https://github.com/riboseinc/libnereon).

See the libnereon
[instructions](https://github.com/rioseinc/libnereon/README.md) for
information on configuration syntax.
